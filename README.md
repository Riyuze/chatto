# How to Run
This project is comprised of two main components, the front-end and the back-end.\
The front-end is located in the client directory and the back-end is located in the server directory.

## Front-end
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Back-end
This project was made using ExpressJS and SocketIO.\
Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.\
Find out more here: https://expressjs.com/

Socket.IO is a library that enables low-latency, bidirectional and event-based communication between a client and a server.\
It is built on top of the WebSocket protocol and provides additional guarantees like fallback to HTTP long-polling or automatic reconnection.\
Find out more here: https://socket.io/

Development was made easy using nodemon, which automatically restarts the node application everytime a file change is detected.\

## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
The server will reload when you make changes.
